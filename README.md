# Advent of Code 2024 🎄
Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)!

This repository contains my daily solutions to the puzzles, written in Python. My goal is to solve these challenges while learning, having fun, and testing my problem-solving skills without external shortcuts. 🚀

## Self-Imposed Rules 🛑

I am setting the following rules for myself:

1. **Language:** All solutions will be written in **Python**.

2. **No AI Assistance:** I will not use ChatGPT, Copilot, or any generative AI tools to help solve the puzzles.

3. **Original Thinking:** Solutions will be entirely my own, without directly copying code from external sources.

## Repository Structure 📁
Each day has its own folder containing:

* input.txt: The puzzle's input data.
* solution.py: My Python solution to the challenge.
* README.md (optional): A brief description of the problem and my approach.****
